A tool which makes downloading and managing Go projects and their dependencies somewhat easier.  EXPERIMENTAL.

THIS IS A HACKDAY PROJECT.
--------------------------
This package is very, very hacky.  While the core concept is sound (think Bundler for Go), it's nonetheless very fragile, and NOT ready for production use.
It lacks documentation, test automation, and so on.

Plus, it's not written in Go yet.  :-)
